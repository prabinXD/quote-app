# Fetch Quote - Explanation for Beginners

This README is a beginner-friendly explanation of how a JavaScript `fetch` request is used to get data from an API and update the webpage dynamically. The example shown fetches a quote and displays it, handling both success and error cases, and hiding a loading spinner afterward.

## Code Breakdown

```
fetch(url)
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Quote not found");
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    quoteContainer.innerHTML = `<p>"${data.quote}"<br><strong>- ${data.author}</strong></p>`;
  })
  .catch(error => {
    quoteContainer.innerHTML = `<p style="color:red;">Error: ${error.message}</p>`;
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // Hide spinner
    spinner.style.display = "none";
  });
```

### Line-by-line Explanation

- **`fetch(url)`**: Initiates a network request to the given `url`. This is commonly an API endpoint that returns data like quotes.
- **`.then(response => { ... })`**: Runs after the fetch is complete. The `response` object contains information about the result.
    - **`if (!response.ok)`**: Checks if the HTTP status code is not in the 200â€“299 range. If it isn't, an error is thrown.
    - **`throw new Error("Quote not found")`**: Creates a custom error that will be caught by the `.catch()` block.
    - **`return response.json()`**: Converts the response data from JSON format to a JavaScript object.
- **`.then(data => { ... })`**: Executes once the JSON has been successfully parsed. `data` now contains the quote and author.
    - **`quoteContainer.innerHTML = ...`**: Updates the webpage with the quote and author using HTML.
- **`.catch(error => { ... })`**: Catches any errors from the fetch or the previous `.then()` blocks.
    - **Displays an error message** in red text if the fetch fails or the response isn't valid.
- **`.finally(() => { ... })`**: This block always runs whether the request was successful or not.
    - **`spinner.style.display = "none"`**: Hides a loading spinner after the process is done.

## Summary

This code is a great example for beginners learning:

- How to use `fetch()` for making API calls
- How to handle promises with `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()`
- How to update HTML dynamically with JavaScript
- How to show or hide elements like a loading spinner
